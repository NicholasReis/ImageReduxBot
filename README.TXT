There is a lot of explaining that needs to go into this.
It isn't flawless, and it didn't follow the plan we discussed
of putting it on facebook, but I have requested authorization from
instagram and facebook almost a month ago, and twitter a week ago as
a back up. Last night since nobody responded I was just going to
comment what I was going to do, but my brother suggested tumblr and
their api registration was immediate so I worked through the night to
get this whole thing up and running. There is some sort of an error
in the DataFiller() class that shows up in the console. It still posts
though. I have left most of the comments and explanations for the code
in the classes, specifically UI, DataFiller, DataGrabber.

The information in DataFiller is vital in explaining which pieces don't
work and why they don't work. It 95% works except for one hiccup that
as far as I can tell is a problem with how the API was built.

To run you just have to use the main method in UI.
You can check the output in the output folder to further understand
the information given in the DataFiller and DataGrabber class since
they were responsible for a lot of the file reading and writing.
You can also check the images get posted at imagereduxbot.tumblr.com

The IDE I used was blueJ. I tried to migrate it to eclipse for
everyone else's convenience, but I couldn't get the jars to work
properly, so if there are weird issues it might just work better on
blueJ.
